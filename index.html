				<br>
                 In history, aviation related activities were focused on helping the country, such as in times of calamity, distress and many more, for the welfare of our citizens. 
				Likewise in this project, we also try to reach out and deliver assistance to those students who need help in managing their school activities,
				just like how aviation does to our country which is why we present THS-SPT-0067 — a fighter plane — our own symbolism for motivation for its traits of speed, 
				agility, power, and precision; embodying the spirit of of overcoming obstacles and achieving victory, which makes it ideal for motivation and productivity.

            We aim to help students with their issues in school, such as helping them improve their academic skills, encourage them to do better, and give them support and encouragement to help them in their schoolwork.

            <br>
  In most cases, when the student applies both consistency and productivity in their academics, they disregard their other basic human activities (eating on time, forgetting breaks, not sleeping, etc.) 
and so, the timer below (after the downloading of notion) is our solution to those unhealthy practices. 
Through this, those practices are soon to bid farewell and welcome the practice perfect students of THS !
