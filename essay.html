Some may argue that gadgets are actually useful in learning development. Students can research and find resources that can help them in their learning. 
Yes, gadgets can provide these advantages, but they also have disadvantages that serve as both a distraction and a problem to students. It is best if the students themselves handle their time wisely between their activities and gadgets. 
They can start by first doing their responsibilities in their assignments before using their gadgets in their free time to prevent issues like cramming. Also, they should also know how to use their gadgets wisely,
 whether they are to be used for entertainment or for educational purposes only. They should also make time away from their gadgets to rest their eyes and minds from screen time. 

        </p>

            To conclude, gadgets can pose a problem in learning productivity, but with the right use and handling, it will at least minimize the problem and help students handle their responsibilities in school more effectively.
